# cricket-statistics
ODI runs of all cricketers till date
I have used python libraries like beautiful soup and requests to collect data of the ODI players and their cumulative runs
till date
Requests library opens up the website 
source file of the webpage is sparsed and the only needed data is extracted using BeautifulSoup
pandas is used to arrange the data in order
